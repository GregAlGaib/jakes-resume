This is an updated version of Jake's Resume, formatted for improved ATS parsing and AI parsing (done by [SWEResume.app](https://www.sweresume.app)). Jake's Resume is a popular LaTeX resume template widely used in the tech industry. It features a clean, single-column layout with Computer Modern fonts, making it highly readable by both humans and Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). The template became popular on Reddit and GitHub for its professional appearance and proven success in landing interviews at top tech companies.

Jake's Resume is popular because it's ATS-optimized, uses clean formatting that hiring managers love, and has been proven to work at FAANG companies. The minimalist design keeps focus on your experience and skills without distracting graphics. It's also easy to customize and maintains consistent formatting across different PDF viewers.

You can customize Jake's Resume in two ways: 1) Download the PDF template (faster to use the tool linked at the top) or 2) Copy the LaTeX code ("sweresume.app-jakes-resume.tex" file) and edit it directly in Overleaf or your local LaTeX environment.
